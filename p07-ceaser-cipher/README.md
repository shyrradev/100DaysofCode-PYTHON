Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
This Python program implements a Caesar cipher, which is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encryption: Allows you to encrypt a message by shifting each letter in the message by a specified number of places down the alphabet.
Decryption: Allows you to decrypt an encrypted message by shifting each letter in the opposite direction.
Usage
Input: The program prompts the user for:

Whether to 'encode' (encrypt) or 'decode' (decrypt) a message.
The message to be encrypted or decrypted.
The shift number (the number of places to shift each letter in the alphabet).
Output: After processing the input:

For encryption, the program outputs the encrypted message.
For decryption, the program outputs the decrypted message.
