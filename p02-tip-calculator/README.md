# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates the tip amount and the total amount each person should pay when splitting a bill.

## Usage

The script prompts the user to enter the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill. It then calculates the tip amount and the total amount each person should pay, rounding to two decimal places for accuracy.
