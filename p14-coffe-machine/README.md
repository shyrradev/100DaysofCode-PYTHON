# Coffee Machine

This is a simple coffee machine simulation written in Python. The machine serves three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. It keeps track of its resources (water, milk, and coffee), processes orders based on user input, handles resource shortages, manages monetary transactions, and can generate a report of the remaining resources.
